  - CERN-LHC. Detailed measurements of $t$-channel single top-quark production are presented. They use $20.2~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS experiment in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC. Total, fiducial and differential cross-sections are measured for both top-quark and top-antiquark production. The fiducial cross-section is measured with a precision of $5.8~\%$ (top quark) and $7.8~\%$ (top antiquark), respectively. The total cross-sections are measured to be $\sigma_\mathrm{tot}(tq) = 56.7^{+4.3}_{-3.8}\;\mathrm{pb}$ for top-quark production and $\sigma_\mathrm{tot}(\bar{t} q) = 32.9^{+3.0}_{-2.7}\;\mathrm{pb}$ for top-antiquark production, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. In addition, the ratio of top-quark to top-antiquark production cross-sections is determined to be $R_t=1.72 \pm 0.09$. The differential cross-sections as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of both the top quark and the top antiquark are measured at both the parton and particle levels. The transverse momentum and rapidity differential cross-sections of the accompanying jet from the $t$-channel scattering are measured at particle level. All measurements are compared to various Monte Carlo predictions as well as to fixed-order QCD calculations where available.

description: Predicted and observed event yields for the signal region (SR). The multijet background prediction is obtained from a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ distribution. All the other predictions are derived using theoretical cross-sections, given for the backgrounds in Sect. 6 and for the signal in Sect. 1. The quoted uncertainties are in the predicted cross-sections or in the number of multijet events, in case of the multijet process.

description: Uncertainties for the normalised differential $tq$ cross-section as a function of $p_{\mathrm{T}}(t)$ at parton level per bin ([0,50,100,150,200,300] GeV) in percent of $\left(\dfrac{1}{\sigma}\right)\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\sigma(tq)}{\mathrm{d}p_{\mathrm{T}}(t)}$. If the uncertainty reported in the paper is "0.0" for both the $\textit{plus}$ and $\textit{minus}$ variation, the value "+0.01" is assigned to the $\textit{plus}$ variation for technical reasons.
